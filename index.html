            <h2>About Me </h2>
            <p class="about-paragraph">Hello! I'm Turner. My journey into holistic healing began, as many do, with my own personal path of healing and transformation. I fell in love with inner growth through deep practice in Yoga, Reiki, Meditation, Pranayama, and Shipibo Plant Dietas. My work is inspired by my life-long immersion in these practices—from the stillness of Zazen from Upaya Zen Center, the Sivananda Hatha Yoga of Yogi Hari's Ashram, and the profound mystical healing traditions of the indigenous Shipibo of Peru. I have immersed myself within these cultures to bring you embodied teachings. I first discovered Reiki in 2020 and have deepened this practice with my mentor, Valerie Brodar. Today, I channel the powerful alignment of all these profound inner growth practices—providing guidance and ensuring a balanced, supported session for you. My life is dedicated to these healing arts, and I am passionate about sharing them with you.</p>
