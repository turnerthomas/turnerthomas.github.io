                <p class="about-paragraph">Hello! I'm Turner. My journey into holistic healing began with my own path of transformation. I fell in love with my inner landscape through deep practice in Yoga, Reiki, Meditation, Pranayama, and Shipibo Plant Dietas. My work is inspired by my life-long immersion in these practices—from the stillness of Zazen at Upaya Zen Center to the profound healing traditions of the indigenous Shipibo of Peru. Today, I channel the alignment of these practices to provide guidance and ensure a balanced, supported session for you.</p>
