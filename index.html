    <h2>About Me & My Practice</h2>
    <p class="about-paragraph">Hello! I'm Turner. My journey into holistic healing began, as many do, with my own personal path of healing and transformation. I fell in love with the art of inner growth through deep practice in Yoga, Reiki, Meditation, Pranayama, and Shipibo Plant Dietas. My work is inspired by my life-long immersion in these practices—from the stillness and structure of Upaya Zen Center, the disciplined training from Yogi Hari's Ashram, and the profound mystical healing traditions of the indigenous Shipibo people of Peru. I have immersed myself within these cultures to bring you embodied teachings. I first discovered Reiki in 2020 and have honed in on this practice with my mentor Valerie Brodar. Today, I channel the alignment of all these profound inner growth practices when sending Reiki and provide guidance, ensuring a balanced and supported session for you. My life is dedicated to these practices and I want to share my passion for these healing arts with you.</p>
